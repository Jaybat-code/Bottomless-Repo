A teacher in Sutherland High School is tired of manually entering grades, class averages ect.
they want an easy system where they can type all 24 grades from their students and see if they passed or failed
in the testing demo they want a wide range of values so if a score is not inputted it will cycle through randomly

#Components:
> Body
 >Main Container
  >Controller (where you input the information){
   >Add Student: A button that pushes a new student score into an array if a value is not selected it will pick randomly trhough 60 and 100
        > Our goofy dev doesn't know how objects work quite yet so there will be a massive array with unique names that will be tagged with a student score for later identification
   >Delete Student: Removes the last student that was inputted into the array
   >Compute Data: Does the calculation in the background to be displayed in the output section.
  }
  >OutPut{
    It will show the class average, pass/fail rate, all student scores and when you hover over a student score an ID card will show up with the studends name, grade and it will also share a weird quirk about them.
